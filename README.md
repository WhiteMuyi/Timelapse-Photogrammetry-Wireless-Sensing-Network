## 1.0 Introduction

The Timelapse Photogrammetry Wireless Sensing Network System (TPWSNSys) is a low-cost, open source timelapse camera control system designed to capture glacier movement in extreme environments. Velocity and change in surface elevation are both critical pieces in understanding how a glacier is responding to the climate, where time-lapse cameras are being used to track glacier velocities and changes in surface elevation over time using feature-tracking and photogrammetry. The camera linked with this sensing loop can open automatically and capture photos at the scheduled times powered by solar energy. 

In this project, we designed a camera that can provide ground-truth data to compare with large-scale, systematic remote sensing data products. By doing this, we targeted to assess the accuracy of these global products, filter the noise, and developed methods to improve these satellite-based datasets.

## 2.0 Methods
