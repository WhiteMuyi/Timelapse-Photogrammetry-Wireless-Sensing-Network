## 1.0 Introduction
<p align="justify"> 
The Timelapse Photogrammetry Wireless Sensing Network System (TPWSNSys) is a low-cost, open source timelapse camera control system designed to capture glacier movement in extreme environments. Velocity and change in surface elevation are both critical pieces in understanding how a glacier is responding to the climate, where time-lapse cameras are being used to track glacier velocities and changes in surface elevation over time using feature-tracking and photogrammetry. The camera linked with this sensing loop can open automatically and capture photos at the scheduled times powered by solar energy. 

<p align="justify"> 
In this project, we designed a camera that can provide ground-truth data to compare with large-scale, systematic remote sensing data products. By doing this, we targeted to assess the accuracy of these global products, filter the noise, and developed methods to improve these satellite-based datasets.


## 2.0 Methods

### 2.1 Design

The Timelapse photogrammetry wireless sensing network is constructed using off-the-shelf components. This system is capable of handling iceberg recording tasks for a year or beyond. The design principles of the system show below, including:
* Inexpensive
* Off-the-shelf components
* Modular
* Power-efficient
* Open sourse
* User friendly
* Robust
